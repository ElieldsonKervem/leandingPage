Project Summary: Bank Neon Web Application

In this small project, I developed a web application for Bank Neon using a stack that includes HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. The application offers a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with banking 
services. The HTML provides the structural foundation, while Sass enhances the styling, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design. The dynamic functionalities are powered by JavaScript, enabling users 
to perform various banking operations with ease. This project showcases my skills in front-end development and my ability to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing web experience for Bank Neon customers.
